This is a recording of the presentation Trucy, Jon, and I gave on Figma's v3 Auto Layout feature for the December "Friends of Figma: Chicago" event. I covered the "why" (i.e. the boring parts) of Auto Layout, and tried to explain why it's important for digital designers to understand the nature of the medium they create for and how Auto Layout incorporates those constraints and features into the design tool we're already familiar with.

Then Trucy and Jon talked about the what and how of Auto Layout. Jon's part was especially fun :)
